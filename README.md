## C++ Skip List Key-Value Store 

**A project for in-depth exploration of the Skip List data structure and building a functional key-value store.**

## Introduction/Background

- The skip list is a highly efficient data structure renowned for its fast search, insertion, and deletion operations, all while maintaining low complexity.
- Its importance in modern systems is evident:
    - **Redis:** This popular in-memory data store leverages skip lists as its core storage engine.
    - **Cloud Databases:** Leading cloud providers rely on databases like RocksDB (built on Google's LevelDB), both of which heavily depend on the power of skip lists.

**This project guides you through a deep dive into skip lists and their application in building a robust key-value store.**

## Project Goals:

1. **Deepen understanding of skip lists:** From theory to practical implementation, covering the intricacies of its structure and operations.
2. **Master efficient data manipulation:** Learn how to implement and optimize crucial functions for insertion, search, and deletion.
3. **Enhance C++ proficiency:** Solidify C++ knowledge through hands-on programming exercises, employing core language features and standard library components. 
4. **Boost problem-solving abilities:** Sharpen analytical and design skills by tackling real-world challenges inherent in building a data store, further cementing understanding of algorithm and data structure applications.

## Project Structure

This project breaks down the key-value store development into clear and manageable modules:

- **skiplist-basics:** Detailed explanations of the fundamental principles behind skip lists.
- **skiplist-definition:** Definition of the Skip List class and its essential members.
- **skiplist-levels:** Implementation of skip list level management and manipulation.
- **skiplist-insertion:** Implementation of efficient insertion algorithms for the skip list.
- **skiplist-deletion:** Implementation of robust deletion algorithms, maintaining data integrity.
- **skiplist-visualization:** Tools and techniques for visualizing the skip list structure.
- **persistence:** Functions for generating and reading data from persistent storage, ensuring durability.
- **module-integration:** Combining all modules to form a complete key-value store system.
- **stress-test:** Rigorous testing procedures designed to push the performance limits of the implementation.
